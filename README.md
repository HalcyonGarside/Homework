# Homework
 A repository of all of the homework that have results I'm proud of.


**ComS_227_IntroToOOP (Intro to Object Oriented Programming)**
 This is where I got the meat of my OOP knowledge.  As of now, there's only one file in there, which essentially put together everything I learned.  The instructors provided us with some code to start off with (Those being the ui, examples, and api packages).  Everything in the hw4 package was written by me based off of what was given in those separate packages.  The result was a game called block attack, which was described as a strange mix between bejeweled and tetris.  That description is one I fully aggree with.
 
 **CprE_185_ProblemSolving**
  All of the files in here were done in C in a weekly lab where participants used a program that interpereted PlayStation DualShock 4 controllers' inputs through a console.  There were a variety of tasks to complete like calculating the pitch and tilt of the controller in real time, creating falling labyrinth games that would use controller input, and creating a program that would take a certain set of words and put them in a matrix in the console to select from to make a sentance.  Unfortunately, one lab was lost to the great beyond, but I managed to salvage the rest.  
  
**ComS_228_IntroToDataStructs**
 This is a class I am currently taking delving further into Java, focusing more on data structures.  The homework given is much more loose, meaning the assignments given are based off of a few pre-made interfaces and a document specifying what needs to be done to finish the assignment.  We were introduced to generic types in the course of the first assignment.  This directory is currently in development, since the class is still running, but this description will be finalized once it is said and done.
  
  I will be consistantly updating this list as more difficult assignments come to me.  If you want more information on my work, contact me at wil.s.blanchard@gmail.com.
