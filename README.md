# Homework
 A repository of all of the homework that have results I'm proud of.


**ComS_227_IntroToOOP**
 This is where I got the meat of my OOP knowledge.  As of now, there's only one file in there, which essentially put together everything I learned.  The instructors provided us with some code to start off with (Those being the ui, examples, and api packages).  Everything in the hw4 package was written by me based off of what was given in those separate packages.  The result was a game called block attack, which was described as a strange mix between bejeweled and tetris.  That description is one I fully aggree with.
 
 **CprE_185_ProblemSolving**
  All of the files in here were done in C in a weekly lab where participants used a program that interpereted PlayStation DualShock 4 controllers' inputs through a console.  There were a variety of tasks to complete like calculating the pitch and tilt of the controller in real time, creating falling labyrinth games that would use controller input, and creating a program that would take a certain set of words and put them in a matrix in the console to select from to make a sentance.  Unfortunately, one lab was lost to the great beyond, but I managed to salvage the rest.  
  
**ComS_228_IntroToDataStructs**
 This is a class delving further into Java, focusing more on data structures.  The homework given is much more loose, meaning the assignments given are based off of a few pre-made interfaces and a document specifying what needs to be done to finish the assignment.  We were introduced to generic types in the course of the first assignment. 

**CprE_308_OperatingSystems**
 This course taught me the basic structure of operating systems using a very simple Linux OS as an example.  Here, I was able to work with process scheduling as well as OS interaction and structure.  Projects in this course involved the creation of programs that would pipe information between processes, utilize scheduling algorithms, and emulate a simple bash terminal complete with background processes.

**CprE_381_CpuOrgAndAssemblyProgramming**
 Here, the focus was centered around the physical organization of computers, the structure of CPUs, and the creation of assembly instructions for those CPUs.  The files in this directory consist mostly of VHDL files describing the structure of a very simple MIPS-compliant CPU and some simple test instruction sets for that CPU.  

**CprE_575_ComputationalPerception**
 This is the class where I was able to learn about... well, computational perception.  This mostly involves computer vision-related topics such as object/pattern recognition with erosion/dilution and audio processing with FFTs/IFFTs, though the end of the course delved lightly into machine learning with hidden markov models and the baum-welch algorithm.  I also worked on a team project in this course which attempted to utilize GANs in forensic handwriting analysis, though our efforts fell short.  You can find more about this project on the "portfolio" tab of my website (https://wilblanchard.weebly.com/portfolio.html).
  
  I will be consistantly updating this list as I scrounge up more homework assignments from college.  If you want more information on my work, please contact me at wil.s.blanchard@gmail.com.
